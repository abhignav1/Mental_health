# Burnout Risk Predictor (Refined Version)

This machine learning model predicts the likelihood of **burnout risk** using screen time, sleep, stress, and digital lifestyle features. Itâ€™s designed to help individuals or wellness applications understand early warning signs of mental fatigue.

## Dataset Source

- Kaggle Dataset: *Impact of Screen Time on Mental Health*
- 2,000 entries of individual behaviors and mental health scores

## Refined Problem Statement

To improve class separation and model focus, the labels were engineered as follows:

```r
burnout_risk = case_when(
  mental_health_score < 45 ~ 1,  # Clearly at risk
  mental_health_score > 65 ~ 0,  # Clearly not at risk
  TRUE ~ NA_real_                # Ambiguous cases removed
)
```

This binary classification targets clearer high-risk vs. low-risk groups.

## Features Used

- Screen time per hour awake
- Stress-to-sleep ratio
- Screen-to-stress ratio
- Sleep hours and quality
- Mood, stress, physical activity
- Caffeine intake and mindfulness

## Model Pipeline

1. Preprocessing
   - Removed NA targets and unimportant ID columns
   - One-hot encoding for categorical data
   - Removal of highly correlated features

2. Model Training
   - **XGBoost** used with AUC as evaluation metric
   - Tuned with cross-validation (`xgb.cv`) and early stopping

3. Output
   - Returns predicted probability and a simple "Yes/No" label for burnout risk

## Model Performance

- **Cross-validated AUC**: Printed during execution
- **Test accuracy**: Measured using confusion matrix

> Note: While accuracy may remain around 50%, the AUC helps assess the model's ability to distinguish between the two classes even with noisy labels.

## Usage Ideas

- Individual wellness tracking
- Integrated wellness app modules
- Employee burnout screening tools
- Mental health check-in forms

## Future Improvements

- Introduce behavioral sequences (time series)
- Collect more granular activity data
- Test deep learning or attention-based models
- Build a deployable REST API
